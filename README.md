# News-Article-Categorization-Using-Pyspark-
 News article classification is a critical problem  in the field of NLP, which  has a wide range of applications. This project investigates the effectiveness of  various machine learning models for categorizing news  articles into predefined categories. The models are tested using a Kaggle dataset.
 # Proposed System
 The proposed system is divided into the following steps 
1) Lemmatization and Stemming 
2) Tokenization 
3) Feature Selection and Feature Reduction 
4) Data Balancing(PCA) 
5)Classification
